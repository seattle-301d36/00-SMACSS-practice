##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I followed the rules in the documentation for the assignment. It was hard for me to decide whether or not I wanted aside/header/footer specific content in modules.css or layout.css, but I wanted to keep the higher level files as clutter free as possible so I decided to place that content in with modules.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, the initial file looked good.
