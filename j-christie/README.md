##### How did you determine which rules should be placed in each new CSS file?

I choose the largest elements and put them in the base. Then I moved everything else to modules and went through each one and determined importance of page layout. If it was holding a large part of the page together it got moved to layout.

##### Did you do any refactoring of the existing CSS? If so, briefly explain what you did and why.

No, I like things that work!
